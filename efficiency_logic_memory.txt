Efficiency Calculation Logic:
The efficiency of an agent or the council is calculated as follows:
Efficiency % = ( (Accepted_Count + (Partial_Count * 0.5)) / Total_Suggestions ) * 100

- Accepted Suggestion: 1 point
- Partially Accepted Suggestion: 0.5 points
- Rejected Suggestion: 0 points

Stats are tracked in-memory within the Council class and are persisted to disk:
1. File: `~/.council-ai/stats.json` (protected with 0600 permissions).
2. Stats are loaded on startup, so efficiency data is preserved across sessions.
3. Stats are reset only when the user explicitly issues the `/new` command or clears history.
