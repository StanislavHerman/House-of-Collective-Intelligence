Efficiency Calculation Logic:
The efficiency of an agent or the council is calculated as follows:
Efficiency % = ( (Accepted_Count + (Partial_Count * 0.5)) / Total_Suggestions ) * 100

- Accepted Suggestion: 1 point
- Partially Accepted Suggestion: 0.5 points
- Rejected Suggestion: 0 points

Stats are tracked in-memory within the Council class and are reset:
1. When the application is restarted.
2. When the user issues the `/new` command.
Stats are NOT persisted to disk.
